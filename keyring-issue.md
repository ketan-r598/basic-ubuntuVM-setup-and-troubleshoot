## Issue: Keyring does not unlock autmatically.

This issue typically occurs because the login keyring, which stores your passwords securely, is not being unlocked automatically when you log in. This can happen for several reasons, such as changing your login password without updating the keyring password or the keyring being set to require a password.

To fix this issue, you can try the following steps:

## Method 1: Resetting the Keyring Password

### Open the Passwords and Keys Application
You can find it by searching for "Passwords and Keys" in your application menu.

### Delete the Default Keyring
1. In the left panel, look for a keyring named "Login."
2. Right-click on the "Login" keyring and select "Delete."

### Create a New Keyring
1. After deleting the keyring, create a new one by clicking on `File` > `New` > `Password Keyring`.
2. Name it "Login" and set a password for it. If you want it to unlock automatically, set the password to be the same as your login password.
